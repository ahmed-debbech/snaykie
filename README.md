## Snaykie
A very simple snake game that was developed as an educational project for C++ Programming language.
Snaykie uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) Library as a dependency.
<B> This is a work in progress by Ahmed Debbech. </B>
#### Project status
Snaykie still under development.
#### Installation
* Compile from source: clone the repo in your desired dirctory and then a 'make' command will compile & excute from source. \
Note: You should install [SDLv1.2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php) in order to work properly.

#### Usage
Open the app and then move the snake with arrows. Thats it! \
