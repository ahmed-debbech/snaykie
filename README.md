# Snaykie
A very simple snake game that was developed as an educational project for C++ Programming language. \
Snaykie uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) Library. \
<B> This is a work in progress by Ahmed Debbech. </B>
### Project status
Snaykie is still under development. \
Latest version is: v0.3.0
### Installation
* Compile from source: clone the repo in your desired directory and then a 'make' command in the 'src' directory will compile & execute from source. \
Note: You should install [SDLv1.2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php) in order to work properly.
* You can download the Windows binary from [here](http://bit.ly/2r5SvPa).
decompress the zip file and open the folder and execute 'snaykie.exe'
### Usage
Open the app and then move the snake with arrows. That's it! \
And don't hit the wall or yourself. \
### Contribution
Pull requests are of course welcome. For major changes please open an issue first to discuss. \
Fork the repo even if you just want to experiment with it.
* All Prod. and mainline releases are maintained only by Ahmed Debbech. \
No documentation is available yet as the project is still in progress and the API is not considered stable.
